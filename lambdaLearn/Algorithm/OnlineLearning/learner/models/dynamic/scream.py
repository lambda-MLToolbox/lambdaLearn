class Scream(Model):
    """Implementation of Non-stationary Online Learning with Memory and
    Non-stochastic Control.

    ``Scream`` is designed the optimize the dynamic regret for online convex
    optimization with switching cost. In the technical aspect, it neatly solves
    the challenge of controlling the switching cost in the meta-base two-layer
    structure while enjoying the desired dynamic regret bound. It is shown to
    enjoy :math:`\mathcal{O}(\sqrt{T(1+P_T)})` dynamic regret with switching
    cost.

    Args:
        domain (Domain): Feasible set for the algorithm.
        T (int): Total number of rounds.
        G (float): Upper bound of gradient.
        penalty (float): Penalty coefficient of switching cost.
        min_step_size (float): Minimal step size for the base-learners. It is
            set as the theory suggests by default.
        max_step_size (float): Maximal step size for the base-learners. It is
            set as the theory suggests by default.
        prior (str, numpy.ndarray, optional): The initial decisions of all
            base-learners are set as `domain(prior=prior, see=seed)` for the
            algorithm.
        seed (int, optional): The initial decisions of all base-learners are set
            as `domain(prior=prior, see=seed)` for the algorithm.
