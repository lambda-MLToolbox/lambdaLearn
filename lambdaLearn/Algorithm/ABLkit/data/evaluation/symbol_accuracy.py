class SymbolAccuracy(BaseMetric):
    """
    A metrics class for evaluating symbol-level accuracy.

    This class is designed to assess the accuracy of symbol prediction. Symbol accuracy
    is calculated by comparing predicted presudo labels and their ground truth.

    Parameters
    ----------
    prefix : str, optional
        The prefix that will be added to the metrics names to disambiguate homonymous
        metrics of different tasks. Inherits from BaseMetric. Defaults to None.

    def process(self, data_examples: ListData) -> None:

        Processes a batch of data examples.

        This method takes in a batch of data examples, each containing a list of predicted
        pseudo-labels (pred_pseudo_label) and their ground truth (gt_pseudo_label). It
        calculates the accuracy by comparing the two lists. Then, a tuple of correct symbol
        count and total symbol count is appended to ``self.results``.

        Parameters
        ----------
        data_examples : ListData
            A batch of data examples, each containing:
            - ``pred_pseudo_label``: List of predicted pseudo-labels.
            - ``gt_pseudo_label``: List of ground truth pseudo-labels.

        Raises
        ------
        ValueError
            If the lengths of predicted and ground truth symbol lists are not equal.
